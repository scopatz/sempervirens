Privacy Policy
==============

Your personal privacy is an important factor that the Sempervirens project and Numfocus 
(our legal entity) considers in the development of each of our products and services. 
We are committed to gathering NO personal information through sempervirens. We are 
committed to being transparent and open. This Privacy Policy explains generically how 
we receive information from you, and what we do with that  information once we have it.

What do we mean by "personal information?"
------------------------------------------

The phrase "personal information" means information which identifies you, such as your 
name, email address, twitter account names, or other user names. Any information that 
falls outside of this is "non-personal information."

Combining non-personal information with personal information we consider to be 
"personal information."  Such combinations will not be collected. Removing all 
personal information creates a data set that is deemed "non-personal information" 
and may be collected.

How do we learn information about you?
---------------------------------------

We learn non-personal information about you when:

* you give it to us directly (e.g., when you choose to send us crash reports);
* we collect it automatically through our products and services (e.g., the Sempervirens 
  code); or
* when you have opted-out of sending other non-personal information, we record that an 
  opt-out event has occurred.


What do we do with your information once we have it?
----------------------------------------------------

When you give us information, we will use it in the ways for which you've given us 
permission. Generally, we use your information to help us provide and improve our 
products and services to you and for you. This includes aggregations of the information 
to display data such as global usage statistics.

What are usage statistics?
--------------------------

Usage statistics or "telemetry" is a feature of Sempervirens that sends Numfocus usage, 
performance, and responsiveness statistics about user interface features, application 
program interfaces (APIs), application binary interfaces (ABIs), memory, hardware 
configuration. Your IP address is also collected as a part of a standard web log. 
Usage statistics are transmitted using standard and open encryption technologies 
(e.g. TLS) and help us improve future versions of our products are services. Once sent 
to Numfocus, usage statistics are aggregated and made available to the public.

When do we share your information with others?
----------------------------------------------

When we are fulfilling our mission of being open, we will share releases of non-personal 
information to make our products better and foster an open source software development 
community. We will only share non-personal information and try to disclose it in a way 
that minimizes the risk of you being identified.

We will also share information when the law requires it. We follow the law whenever we 
receive requests about you from a government or related to a lawsuit. We'll notify you 
when we're asked to hand over your non-personal information in this way, unless we're 
legally prohibited from doing so. Nothing in  this policy is intended to limit any legal 
defences or objections that  you may have to a third party's request to disclose your 
information.

When we believe it is necessary to prevent harm to you or someone else we may release 
your non-personal information. We will only share your information in this way if we 
have a good faith belief that it is reasonably necessary to protect the rights, 
property or safety of you, our other users, Sempervirens, Numfocus or the public.

How do we store and protect your information?
-------------------------------------------------

We are committed to never storing personal information. 

We are committed to protecting your non-personal information once we have it. 
We implement physical, business, and technical security measures as needed. 
Despite our efforts, if we learn of a security breach, we'll notify you so that you 
can take appropriate protective steps.

How will we notify you?
------------------------

Since no personal information is ever stored, no direct contact with you will ever be 
initiated. Notifications will be issued via public broadcasts such as via twitter, our 
website, or our mailing list.

What else should you know?
---------------------------

We're  a global organization and our computers are in several different places around 
the world. We also use service providers whose computers may also be in various 
countries. This means that your information might end  up on one of those computers 
in another country, and that country may have a different level of data protection 
regulation than yours. By  giving us information, you consent to this kind of transfer 
of your information. No matter what country your information is in, we comply with 
applicable law and will also abide by the commitments we make in  this privacy policy.

If you are under 13, we don't want your information, and you must not 
provide it to us. If you are a parent and believe that your child who is under 13 
has provided us with personal or non-personal information, please contact us. 

What if we change this privacy policy or any of our privacy notices?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

We may need to change this policy and our notices. The updates will be posted online 
via the broadcast notification channels listed above.
